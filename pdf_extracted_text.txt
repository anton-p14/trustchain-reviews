Decentralized Review System - “TrustChain Reviews”

e TrustChain Reviews is a decentralized review ecosystem built on the
Cardano blockchain, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and fairness in
online feedback.

Every review is stored immutably on-chain, linked to a verified wallet
identity (DID) — preventing fake, paid, or deleted reviews.

Smart contracts manage review submission, verification, and rating
aggregation, ensuring trustless and tamper-proofdata.

A token-based reward system encourages genuine reviews and community-
based verification.

Businesses can build transparent brand reputations, and users retain
ownership of their opinions.

The project aims to strengthen consumer trust and promote real-world
Cardano adoption in e-commerce and service industries.
